The pin header used by MikroElektronika for the mikroBUS Shuttle appears to be a CNC 3221-16-0300-00, available from DigiKey (not Mouser). Most other shrouded pin headers do not have the "open sides" (or only have them at the bottom of the pin header but not near the top).

The partially-shrouded 1.27mm pin header used for the ARM SWD debug port is a Samtec FTSH-105-01-F-DV-K-P. The -K specifies the keyed partial shroud and -P specifies a pick & place pad for simplified machine assembly.
